Contains login logout and contactus page

I have done the technical task using Html and css as frontend and python at the backend.
I have designed three pages 
1. Signup page
2. Login Page
3. Contact Us Page
Signup Page contains username email and passwords to be filled. Once filled user will be redirected to Login page. If the user already has an account He can directly go to login page
Login page contains username and password to be filled. Data will be authenticated then user will be redirected to Contact us page
In contact us page I had made a logout button clicking on which user again comes at Login page
once user fills the details on contact form a message is popped out saying form has been submitted.
